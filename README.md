Checkout Flow Redesign – Food Delivery E-commerce Website

Project Overview

The goal of this project was to improve the checkout experience by making it faster, simpler, and more user-friendly. The old design had multiple issues that caused users to abandon their carts.


1. Problems in the Original Checkout Flow

🔴 Too Many Steps – Checkout was long and time-consuming.
🔴 Hidden Fees – Extra costs appeared too late in the process.
🔴 Manual Address Entry – No auto-fill or saved addresses.
🔴 Confusing Payment Process – Users had to go through multiple screens.
🔴 No Progress Indicator – Users didn’t know how many steps remained.


2. Key Improvements in the Redesign

✅ Fewer Checkout Steps – Reduced unnecessary screens.
✅ Transparent Pricing – All costs shown upfront.
✅ Faster Address Entry – Added auto-fill and saved addresses.
✅ Simplified Payment Selection – Everything on one screen.
✅ Progress Indicator – Users can see how far they are in the process.
